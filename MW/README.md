# recipe_box_compagny
A repository for a class project in XML and its linked technologies to create a database for recipes box compagny. 

This class project aim to:
- Create an XML schema for modeling the database
- The XML database for the recipe box compagny
- 7 ways to display a part of the XML data through XSLT with 1 in JSON and another in HTML
- The data display in JSON should correspond to a JSON schema

The database will be inspired from [goodfood] (https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/best-recipe-subscription-boxes) and must contain:
- recipes and menus compose with them
- the delivery mode
- the number of order for the menu
- the rating for the menu as well as for the recipe
- the comment from custommers for the recipes as well as the menu

- The recipes will be referenced (attribute) and they will contain:
  - a name/title (string)
  - ingredients (string)

  - number of recipes (integer between 1 to 7)
  - list of recipe name with their id

  - The rating (integer between 0 to 5), comments (string), number of order (integer)
  - Delivery mode (string within a list: once week, twice week, daily)
  - Category (string with id)

- The Category will have an attribute to refer to it and will contain:
  - The list of recipies in the category with their id 

  XSLT transformation ideas:
  - make an invoice link toward the ressource : https://www.reddit.com/r/web_dev_help/comments/3vhoph/using_xslt_to_generate_an_invoice/
  - make a table with all the ingredient sort by season the ressource : https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/inside-xslt/0735711364/0735711364_ch11lev1sec13.html#:~:text=Creating%20tables%20in%20XSL%2DFO,to%20specify%20the%20table's%20body.
