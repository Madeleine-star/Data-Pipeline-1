The aim of this file is to do a JSON schema which follow the data in the Customer.json file
create by the JSON_customers.xsl file. 
For the customer object, we choose to set the minimum of properties
at 5 because we need at least the name, the full address and a way to contact it either by email or phone.
They are also required except the phone number. 
We don't allow here to add any array type because we want one element correspond to one information. 
We constraint all the element in the object to have at least one item
